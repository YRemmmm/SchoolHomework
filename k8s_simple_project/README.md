## Usage Instructions

Due to the large size of the JDK file, it has not been included to keep the repository lightweight. Please manually place the file `jdk-17_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz` into the following directories: `word-custom`, `user-custom`, and `common-custom`. After that, run the command `sh build.sh` to proceed.
